# hb_chess
Chessboard coding challenge for Humble Bundle.

The code is a Ruby class, Chess. To instantiate a class, pass in a board state.
For example:

    test_board = [
      ['BR','BN','BB','BK','EE','BB','BN','BR'],
      ['BP','BP','BP','BP','EE','BP','BP','BP'],
      ['EE','EE','EE','EE','EE','EE','EE','EE'],
      ['EE','EE','EE','EE','BP','EE','BQ','EE'],
      ['EE','EE','EE','WP','WP','EE','WQ','EE'],
      ['EE','EE','EE','EE','EE','EE','EE','EE'],
      ['WP','WP','WP','EE','EE','WP','WP','WP'],
      ['WR','WN','WB','WK','EE','WB','WN','WR']
    ]

    chess = Chess.new(test_board)

If no board state is specified, a standard starting chess board will be used.

Once you have a Chess object, you can call print_moves and pass a color as a string to see the possible moves for that player.

The string passed in only has to have 'w' or 'b' as the first character, so 'white', 'B', or 'Black' would all work.

Creating a standard starting chess board and calling print_moves for the white player will list every possible move along with a summary.

    chess = Chess.new
    chess.print_moves('w')

Will output the following:

    Pawn at <7:1> can move to <5:1>
    Pawn at <7:1> can move to <6:1>
    Pawn at <7:2> can move to <5:2>
    Pawn at <7:2> can move to <6:2>
    Pawn at <7:3> can move to <5:3>
    Pawn at <7:3> can move to <6:3>
    Pawn at <7:4> can move to <5:4>
    Pawn at <7:4> can move to <6:4>
    Pawn at <7:5> can move to <5:5>
    Pawn at <7:5> can move to <6:5>
    Pawn at <7:6> can move to <5:6>
    Pawn at <7:6> can move to <6:6>
    Pawn at <7:7> can move to <5:7>
    Pawn at <7:7> can move to <6:7>
    Pawn at <7:8> can move to <5:8>
    Pawn at <7:8> can move to <6:8>
    Knight at <8:2> can move to <6:1>
    Knight at <8:2> can move to <6:3>
    Knight at <8:7> can move to <6:6>
    Knight at <8:7> can move to <6:8>
    20 legal moves (10 unique pieces) for white player

Note that all methods called by print_moves calculate using 0-7 as indices for rows and columns, but the output (generated by formatted_moves) converts this to 1-8.
